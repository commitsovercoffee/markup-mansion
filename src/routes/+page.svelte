				I kicked off my career as a freelancer, working on a variety of projects, building frontend,
				microservices, middleware and dashboards. ✨

				Currently, I work as a technical consultant at Quest Alliance, where I mostly focus on
				solutioning, development & support. 🎯

				When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me cycling, shooting hoops, reading, writing, or
				tinkering with side projects. 🧭
