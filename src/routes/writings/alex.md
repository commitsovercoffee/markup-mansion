# Alex's Genius Struggle

![alt text](https://picsum.photos/200/300)

## Introduction

Some days, I wonder what it’s like to be _normal_. You know, one of those people who doesn't spend all day explaining basic concepts to their family. But then I remember—oh, wait, _I’m the only one in this house who isn’t a walking, talking disaster_.

---

## The Daily Struggle

Let’s start with **Mom** and **Dad**.

First, there’s **Mom**—I love her, but let’s face it, I’m the one holding this family together intellectually. She’s constantly making jokes about how "organized" she is, yet I’m the one who has to remind her how to use the calendar on her phone. She tries to take credit for our family’s success in life, but I’m the one doing all the mental heavy lifting here. I can't even count how many times I’ve had to save her from getting _completely lost in an email thread_.

And **Dad**—let’s not even get started. His idea of a fun evening involves a DIY project that’s guaranteed to be an **absolute failure**, yet he somehow expects praise for it. The other day, he tried explaining basic physics to me after he “invented” a new way to fix the sink. Oh, Phil, you're sweet, but you couldn’t even spell _plumber_ without spellcheck.

## My Siblings

And then, of course, there’s **Haley**. I don’t even know where to begin with her. The girl who thinks a _bachelor’s degree_ is something you get at a dance club and somehow still passes basic biology. I try to explain simple concepts, like how the _earth is round_, and she looks at me like I’m speaking in _ancient Greek_. I’ve given up on having intellectual conversations with her.

Then there’s **Luke**. He’s a special case. He’s like a walking science experiment gone wrong. The kid's not dumb; he’s just... well, let’s just say he’s _a little less refined than the rest of us_. You’d think he would’ve caught on to the basic rules of logic by now. No, instead, he spends most of his time inventing _useless gadgets_ that either explode or end up as part of a new science fair disaster. I swear, if I hear him say “It’s _science_” one more time, I might actually combust.

## The Weight of Intelligence

But here's the thing. Despite all their quirks and idiocy, I love them. As frustrating as they are, they’re **family**. They’re my _messy, chaotic_, often _infuriating_ family. And at the end of the day, I can’t help but be proud of the fact that while I might be the only one who can do basic algebra in this house, I’m also the one who keeps this circus running.

So, yes. I am the only smart one here. I’m also the one who will eventually have to _fix their mistakes_ and probably end up explaining things to them for the thousandth time. But that’s okay. I’m used to it by now.

---

## The Final Word

I’m sure in a few years, I’ll look back at this and laugh, or at least feel superior in my **career** while they’re still asking if it’s _okay to microwave plastic_. Until then, I’ll just keep my sanity intact with my trusty books, a very large cup of coffee, and the comforting thought that at least **I’m not as insane as they are**.

---

## Key Takeaways:

- Sometimes it’s hard being the smartest person in the room (especially when that room is filled with _Phil_, _Claire_, and _Luke_).
- **Haley**: Always a fashion icon, never an intellectual.
- **Luke**: Maybe he’s got a future in failed inventions?
- **Family**: Insane, but always worth it in the end.

_Until next time,_  
**Alex Dunphy**
