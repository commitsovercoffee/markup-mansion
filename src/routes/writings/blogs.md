Let’s cut to it, this blog exists because I got tired of talking. Not in the
“I hate people” kind of way, but more in the “why am I repeating the same conversations
over and over again when I could just write it down once and point people to it” way.

You know how every new conversation starts the same way? Same surface-level stuff,
same small talk, same context-setting. I hate that. It’s inefficient. You never get
to the good part, the deeper, messier, more interesting bits. This blog is an
attempt to skip the queue and get to that good part quicker. You want to know what
I think? It’s here. Read it. Then let’s talk.

Another reason. I get drained. I can do people ~ talk, interact, discuss, joke around
but only in bursts. Maybe 2–3 weeks of social stuff before I want to shut off the
world and disappear. Also, writing helps me remember what I think. Thoughts are
slippery. You feel strongly about something in the moment, but try to explain it
a week later and it’s gone. Blogs are a memory extension. Write it once, forget
about it, and refer back later. Or just send the link when someone asks about
your stance on XYZ instead of rehasing something I’ve already processed,
structured, and written down.

Why not do this on social media, you ask? Because social media isn’t built for real
depth. It’s built for engagement, brevity, and dopamine loops. I don’t want likes
or followers or algorithmic reach. I want clarity and ownership. That’s why I
built this site inspired by the indie web, those personal, weird, colorful
websites that are anti-corporate and proudly human.

It also made sense to build my own space since I already write all my notes
in markdown, previously with [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki), now
with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/https://obsidian.md/). So throwing some of
that content into a blog format wasn’t a huge leap. It’s personal, it’s flexible,
and it lets me write whatever the hell I want, tech or non-tech, thoughtful or dumb,
structured or messy. It’s just a place to think out loud. Sometimes it’ll be smart.
Sometimes it’ll be garbage. That’s fine. It’s all me.

So yeah. Welcome to the blog. There’s no roadmap, no schedule, and no audience
in mind. If you like it, great. If you don’t, that’s fine too. I’m not writing
for “engagement.” I’m writing because I’d rather drop a link than repeat myself.

And if I ever tell you, “Just check my site,” now you’ll know why.
