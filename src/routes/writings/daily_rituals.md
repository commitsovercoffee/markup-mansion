Some time back I read this book named _Daily Rituals_ by **Mason Curry**, which offers
a glimpse into the daily routines of creatives from various fields and how these
individuals structured their days to nurture creativity.

As someone who has tried to relentlessly live up to the idea of "a good routine"
from an early age. The book was peculiar to me, as it showed me a plethora of habits
and associated personalities. Something I could look up to or look in contrast
with my own ways.

The book has covered daily routines of over 160 individuals including figures like
Charles Darwin, Virginia Woolf (One of my favorite writer), Pablo Picasso & so on.
Which makes it a good sample of habits, to cherry pick and include in your own lives.

There is a certain beauty in the variation of how people spend their days, and
getting to know what reason or belief it is backed by is a delight in its own.

The book will make you think, smile, compare, even judge sometimes as you traverse
through the daily routines of varous individuals. Although it was a flat book,
it was an interesting read as it made me think a certain way, and have constant
argument with myself about how certain folks spent their days and if I'd like
to do the same.

As a homeage to the book, I want to share my daily routine or as I like to call it
now daily rituals. Hopefully this shareout will help someone correct their course,
think of their habits or atleast give them a chuckle.

But before that I'd like to share one quote :

> “All people are the same; only their habits differ.” - Confucius

Let's get started ...

## How did I come up with my routine?

They say health is wealth. So I started exactly there. I have two habits which I
prioritize (mostly) over anything else. They are :

1. Getting a good night's sleep.
2. Going to bed/waking up and having meals at the same time everyday.

There is plenty scientific literature to support that :

- A good sleep is crucial for staying healthy as well as mentally active.
- Aligning daily activites to your body's natural circadian rhythm enhances overall health.

So once I had my sleep & meal time decided, my day naturally got split into chunks.
Then it was only a matter of time that I experimented and figured out what works best for me.

Since I work remotely from home, the main challenge was to avoid a sedentary lifestyle
creeping in. At the same time, I didn't want to overcommit and go for a hyperactive
routine & burnout too quickly. I had clarity that I wanted a long term solution
and not a hack.

## A Day in the Life of - Yours Truly

### Booting Up

I wake up a few hours after sunrise. After I wake up, the first thing I do is
stretch while walking towards the kitchen and chug a full glass of water.
And then, each time I go to pee, I chug some water again as per my thirst.
This simple rituals keep me hydrated throughout the day.

After this, I make my bed and organize my (already clean) workspace. Followed by
some light exercise (jumping jacks, wall sit, push ups, plank, lunges etc) for
10-15 mins. Enough to get my blood flowing, but not too much to get exhausted.

Then, I brush my teeth, trim nails (if needed), wash my face, clear my bowel
and tidy up. Unless I'm travelling I prefer not to bathe in mornings. So after
I wake up, it takes me under an hour to get ready.

### Getting in the Groove

Once I'm ready, I have breakfast (preferably light) around 09:00, either on the
dining table or at my workspace while skimming through mails. After this, I like
to start my day with the most daunting chunk of work that needs attention. And
I work straight out non-stop until lunch while munching fruits in-between
if I feel like.

### Lunch

I have lunch at around 14:00. Lunch is a special time and it is a strict rule to
have my lunch without doing anything else at all. I despise any kind of input
to my brain at this time, so no tv, no phone, not even music is allowed. I like
it to be mundane.

As my brain gets some breathing room, it starts to sort &
organize all my thoughts in the background without any intentional effort. How
I should respond to a mail, approach my next task or the bug at hand, this buffer
time helps me connect the dots and return to work with more clarity.

### Getting Things Done

After lunch, I either try to close what I was working on in the morning or if
there are some small tasks I can finish off I prioritize them. Second half
is also when I prefer to schedule meetings. And my workday ends with me
scheduling replies to be sent next morning for any mails that I need to respond to.

### Work Out

After work, I typically take my bicycle out for a spin. I cycle to a park
4 kms away where I either walk or shoot hoops, before spending some time at the
open gym and heading back home. My cycling is accompanied usually by music or
a podcast. And after I return home, I take a hot/cold shower depending on my mood.

Post this, is unassigned time which is mostly spent running errands, doing
some household work or with family & friends. Then I have dinner at around 21:00
mostly while watching a movie, show or youtube.

### Graceful Shutdown

After dinner, I do whatever I feel like before dozing off as my eyes suggest.
As much as I'd like it to sound cool, this time is usually spend on my computer
working on side projects, lurking on the web , reading, writing or simply getting lost
in thought.

## Special Days

Weekends are more laid-back than workdays, I can sleep in, skip workouts,
or do absolutely nothing, but only if I stick to these rituals :

- First Saturday : Dance with Finance - Review finances & approve major purchases.
- Second Friday : Gaming Night - Inspired by _The Big Bang Theory_.
- Third Tuesday: Grooming Day - Trip to the barber since it's less crowded.
- Last Saturday : Cleaning Day - Dedicated to tidying up the house.

> "Time blocking works wonders!" - People who use time blocking.

## Closing Suggestions

Thanks to my obsessive nature, I’ve spent years refining and perfecting my routine,
always striving for order. And here's the insight I've gained :

- When creating a routine, have an honest conversation with yourself. Set realistic
  expectations and understand that life can throw curveballs, if you only manage to
  hit 60% in a busy month, that’s okay.

- Invest in tools or resources that make it easier for you to stick to your routine,
  whether it's better gear or time-saving strategies. Make your routine work for you,
  not the other way around.

## That's all. See ya.
