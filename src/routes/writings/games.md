## God of War

By Santa Monica Studios

From the very first moment you start playing God of War, you’ll fall in love with
its heart-pounding action. The combat is smooth, satisfying, and incredibly well-crafted.
One of the best parts? The Leviathan Axe. Throwing it never gets old, especially when
you call it back and it lands in your hand with that heavy, cinematic thud. There’s
a real sense of weight and impact, pure magic.

As soon as you begin, the game pulls you in. It’s not just another story, it’s your
story. The voice acting, the visuals, the emotional depth. They all come together
to make you feel like you’re living Kratos’ journey. The characters around you play
a huge role in keeping the game world alive. Mimir’s constant commentary is clever,
insightful, and often hilarious. He’s not just a talking head, he’s one of the best
companions in gaming. The dwarven brothers, Brok and Sindri, add another layer of
charm with their banter, upgrades, and totally opposite personalities. Whether
you’re solving a puzzle, exploring a realm, or just traveling by boat, these
characters make every moment engaging and never let the game feel quiet or empty.

The combat is the true centerpiece. It’s fluid and powerful, giving you multiple
weapons to choose from like the Leviathan Axe and, later, the iconic Blades of
Chaos. Each weapon feels unique, and the skill trees offer different playstyles,
allowing you to tailor combat to your preference. And the boss fights? Absolutely
unforgettable. Each one feels epic and different. They don’t get repetitive either,
the enemy variety and the way they force you to adapt keeps the combat fresh and exciting.

Overall, God of War stands out as one of the best games ever made. With stunning
visuals, a breathtaking soundtrack, top-tier voice acting, memorable characters,
and combat that feels amazing every single time, it’s more than just a game,
it’s an experience.

## God of War Ragnarok

By Santa Monica Studios

As a longtime fan of God of War, I went into Ragnarok with cautious excitement.
I wasn’t expecting too much since sequels don’t always hit the mark. But this
one didn’t just meet expectations, it blew past them. From the very beginning,
Ragnarok builds on everything that made the previous game great and takes it up
a notch. The combat feels even tighter, the characters are more layered, and
the world is bigger and richer. And man, that spear… I can still hear its sound
in my head. The boss fight with Heimdall? One of the most memorable in the whole
series.

What stood out the most to me, though, was how Ragnarok manages to balance everything
so smoothly. The gameplay, the mechanics, the character development, it all just clicks.
Because everything works so well, the story is allowed to take center stage, and it delivers.
It’s powerful, emotional, and full of those moments that stop you in your tracks.
You’ll sit there, controller in hand, just processing what happened.

The world design is smart too. While there are familiar locations from the last game,
the world has genuinely expanded. There are more characters, more layers, and the
writing is sharp, full of wit and emotion. The voice acting continues to be excellent
across the board, and each character feels important in their own way.

Another thing I really appreciated is the game’s length and structure. In an era
of massive open-world games that sometimes feel bloated, God of War Ragnarok feels
just right. It respects your time. If you’re a weekend player, you can stretch
this experience out over a few weeks without ever feeling lost or burnt out. There’s
minimal filler, just rich, immersive storytelling and consistently engaging gameplay.

And even when you’re done? You’ll want to replay it. The combat is that fun.

## Spiderman Remastered

By Insomniac Games

![Spiderman Remastered](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/sm.jpg)

I know the sequel (spiderman 2) might have fine-tuned the mechanics and expanded
the open world, but honestly? Spider-Man Remastered still stands out as one of
the most unforgettable gaming experiences. What keeps pulling me back isn't just
the gameplay though, that’s still top-notch but the incredible storytelling, the
emotional weight behind every character moment, and how perfectly everything is paced.

Let’s talk about the visuals for a second. The remaster brings a whole new level
of polish. The textures are sharper, the lighting’s more dynamic, and New York City
just feels... alive. Whether it’s golden-hour reflections bouncing off skyscrapers
or the buzz of life on the streets below, it all adds to the immersion. And swinging
through Manhattan? Still one of the most exhilarating ways to traverse in any game.
It just never gets old. The combat, too, holds up beautifully - fluid, stylish,
and surprisingly strategic if you want.

But for me, the real soul of this game is its story. This isn’t just Peter Parker
cracking jokes in a spandex suit, this is Peter as an adult, juggling the impossible
weight of being a hero and a person. The game dives deep into his relationships,
regrets, and resilience. There’s a level of emotional maturity here that really
caught me off guard the first time I played.

Then there’s Otto Octavius. Hands down, one of the best villain arcs I’ve seen
in a game. You feel his descent. He starts as this kind, brilliant mentor, and
watching his transformation into Doc Ock is both heartbreaking and inevitable.
The pacing of his arc is so well done that when he finally breaks bad, it doesn’t
feel forced, it feels tragic.

The main story is gripping and never drags, but the game also gives you plenty of
breathing room to explore side quests, city events, and quieter moments in Peter’s life.
Nothing feels like filler. It all adds to the sense that you’re really living as Spider-Man,
with all the highs and lows that come with it.

By the end, it felt like I’d gone on an emotional journey, not just a superhero romp.
The boss fights especially the final one, are more than just flashy set pieces.
They’re packed with meaning and personal stakes. It's rare for a game to nail that
blend of action and storytelling so consistently.

If you’re into the comics, the movies, or just appreciate a well-told story,
Spider-Man Remastered is more than worth your time. A timeless web of story and gameplay.

## Far Cry Primal

By Ubisoft

![Far Cry Primal](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/fcp.jpg)

Far Cry Primal is a game that holds a special place for me, not because of a deep,
emotional story or complex characters, but purely because of how fun and immersive
the gameplay is. Set in 10,000 BC, it throws you into a wild and dangerous world
where you start off as a lone survivor and gradually build up your tribe from nothing.

You begin by gathering wood, plants, and resources to craft weapons, tools, and
shelter. There’s a clear survival element here, with mechanics like a day and
night cycle, temperature changes (yes, you can freeze to death), and dangerous
wildlife ranging from crocodiles to mamoths & sabretooths. The sense of being
in a living, breathing prehistoric world is honestly incredible.

But survival isn’t the only goal, you’re also up against the Udam tribe, a brutal,
cannibalistic enemy that threatens your people. A big part of your journey is recruiting
and growing your own tribe, not just to expand your influence, but to build up enough
strength to take on the Udams. This adds a deeper layer of purpose beyond just exploration
and survival.

The map is huge and filled with tribal outposts to conquer, reminiscent of Assassin’s
Creed’s Borgia towers. Each camp has its own difficulty level and offers rewards,
which pushes you to keep moving, exploring, and expanding your influence. Along the way,
you meet a variety of colorful allies, each bringing something vital to your survival,
whether it’s teaching you how to tame wild beasts, craft stronger weapons, or
create potent tribal potions.

One of the best parts of the gameplay is taming wild animals. Having your own white
wolf by your side, silently stalking enemies and attacking on your command, is
just incredibly fun. You also have an owl that you can send ahead to scout enemy
camps. How cool is that?

It’s a long game with an environment that feels genuinely alive. Whether it's
crafting tools, hunting at night, or sending your pet bear into battle, it
constantly gives you reasons to stay engaged. There aren’t many games like this,
set in such a unique time period, with this level of immersion.

## Portal 2

By Valve

![Portal 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/p2.jpg)

Portal 2 is one of the smartest and most original games ever made. At its core,
it’s a first-person puzzle game built around the use of portals, simple in concept,
but endlessly creative in execution. The puzzles are brilliantly designed, relying
on physics, momentum, timing, and spatial awareness, and they gradually build in
complexity in a way that always feels rewarding.

What sets Portal 2 apart isn’t just the gameplay, it’s the writing, voice acting,
and characters. GLaDOS remains my favorite robot of all time. Her dry, sarcastic
humor paired with Wheatley’s chaotic energy creates an unforgettable dynamic that
carries the entire experience. The dialogue is consistently smart and funny, giving
the game personality without ever dragging down the pace.

I played Portal 2 in high school, and I absolutely loved it. It was one of those
games that stuck with me. Looking back now, the visuals might not be cutting-edge
anymore, but the soundtrack, creativity, humor, and gameplay hold up surprisingly
well. If you’ve never played it, you owe it to yourself to try.
