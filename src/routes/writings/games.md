## God of War

By Santa Monica Studios

![God of War](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/gow.jpg)

From the very first moment you start playing God of War, you’ll fall in love with
its heart-pounding action. The combat is smooth, satisfying, and incredibly well-crafted.
One of the best parts? The Leviathan Axe. Throwing it never gets old, especially when
you call it back and it lands in your hand with that heavy, cinematic thud.

It’s not just another story, it’s your story. The voice acting, the visuals, the
emotional depth. They all come together to make you feel like you’re living Kratos’
journey. The characters around you play a huge role in keeping the game world alive.
Mimir’s constant commentary is clever, insightful, and often hilarious. The dwarven
brothers, Brok and Sindri, add another layer of charm with their banter, upgrades,
and totally opposite personalities. Whether you’re solving a puzzle, exploring a
realm, or just traveling by boat, these characters make every moment engaging and
never let the game feel quiet or empty.

The combat is fluid and powerful, giving you multiple weapons to choose from like
the Leviathan Axe and, later, the iconic Blades of Chaos. Each weapon feels unique,
and the skill trees offer different playstyles, allowing you to tailor combat to
your preference. And the boss fights? Absolutely unforgettable. Each one feels
epic and different. They don’t get repetitive either, the enemy variety and the
way they force you to adapt keeps the combat fresh and exciting.

With stunning visuals, a breathtaking soundtrack, top-tier voice acting, memorable
characters, and combat that doesnt come in the way, it’s more than just a game,
it’s an experience.

## God of War Ragnarok

By Santa Monica Studios

![God of War Ragnarok](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/gowr.jpg)

I wasn’t expecting too much from this game since sequels don’t always hit the mark.
But this one didn’t just meet expectations, it blew past them. From the very beginning,
Ragnarok builds on everything that made the previous game great and takes it up a notch.

The combat feels even tighter, the characters are more layered, and the world is bigger
and richer. And man, that spear… I can still hear its sound in my head. The boss fight
with Heimdall? One of the most memorable in the whole series.

What stood out the most to me, though, was how Ragnarok manages to balance everything
so smoothly. The gameplay, the mechanics, the character development, it all just clicks.
Because everything works so well, the story is allowed to take center stage, and it delivers.
It’s powerful, emotional, and full of those moments that stop you in your tracks.
You’ll sit there, controller in hand, just processing what happened.

The world design is smart too. While there are familiar locations from the last game,
the world has genuinely expanded. There are more characters, more layers, and the
writing is sharp, full of wit and emotion. The voice acting continues to be excellent
across the board, and each character feels important in their own way.

It’s one of those rare sequels that actually improves on everything and sticks the
landing. I didn’t think I’d be this hooked again, but here we are. What a ride.

## Spiderman Remastered

By Insomniac Games

![Spiderman Remastered](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/sm.jpg)

I've played every Spider-Man game out there, and if you’re only going to try one,
this is the one I’d recommend. While Spider-Man 2 may be more refined in terms of
mechanics and polish, I believe this game offers a richer, more complete experience,
especially if you're a Spider-Man fan.

On PC, the upgrades are stunning ~ crisper textures, more dynamic lighting, and a
version of New York City that genuinely feels alive. Whether it’s the golden-hour
glow on glass towers or the energy of the streets below, the world pulls you in.
And swinging through Manhattan never gets old. The combat is just as satisfying,
fast, stylish, and surprisingly strategic if you want.

But for me, the real soul of this game is its story. This isn’t just Peter Parker
cracking jokes in a spandex suit, this is Peter as an adult, juggling the impossible
weight of being a hero and a person. The game dives deep into his relationships,
regrets, and resilience. There’s a level of emotional maturity here that really
caught me off guard the first time I played.

And then there’s Otto Octavius. His journey is one of the most compelling villain
arcs I’ve seen in gaming. He begins as a brilliant, kind mentor, and his transformation
into Doc Ock is heartbreaking because it feels so natural and tragic. The game handles
his descent with incredible pacing and care.

The main story is gripping and never drags, but the game also gives you plenty of
breathing room to explore side quests, city events, and quieter moments in Peter’s life.
Nothing feels like filler. It all adds to the sense that you’re really living as
Spider-Man, with all the highs and lows that come with it.

A timeless web of story and gameplay.

## Far Cry Primal

By Ubisoft

![Far Cry Primal](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/fcp.jpg)

Far Cry Primal holds a special place for me, not because of a deep,
emotional story or characters, but how fun and immersive the gameplay is. Set
in 10,000 BC, it throws you into a wild and dangerous world where you start off
as a lone survivor and gradually build up your tribe from nothing.

You begin by gathering wood, plants, and resources to craft weapons, tools, and
shelter. There’s a clear survival element here, with mechanics like a day and
night cycle, temperature changes (yes, you can freeze to death), and dangerous
wildlife ranging from crocodiles to mamoths & sabretooths.

But survival isn’t the only goal, you’re also up against the Udam tribe, a brutal,
cannibalistic enemy that threatens your people. A big part of your journey is recruiting
and growing your own tribe, to build up enough strength to take on the Udams. This
adds a deeper layer of purpose beyond just exploration and survival.

The map is huge and filled with tribal outposts to conquer, reminiscent of Assassin’s
Creed’s Borgia towers. Each camp has its own difficulty level and offers rewards.
which pushes you to keep moving, exploring, and expanding your influence. Along the way,
you meet a variety of colorful allies, each bringing something vital to your survival,
whether it’s teaching you how to tame wild beasts or craft stronger weapons.

One of the best parts of the gameplay is taming wild animals. Having your own white
wolf by your side, silently stalking enemies and attacking on your command, is
just incredibly fun. You also have an owl that you can send ahead to scout enemy
camps. How cool is that?

There’s a stillness in Primal. For once, it’s not about guns or cars. It’s about you,
the wild, and the silence between survival and extinction. Primal captures that
solitude beautifully.

## Party Hard 2

By Pinokl Games

![Party Hard 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/ph2.jpg)

The premise is simple, absurd, and instantly relatable. It’s 3 a.m., the neighbors
are throwing another soul-killing party, and you’ve had enough. So, you do what
every functioning adult with zero patience does. You crash the party and start
killing people. Not necessarily everyone, but enough to make a point.

That’s the entire premise of Party Hard 2, and somehow, it works incredibly well.
The game blends stealth, strategy, and chaos into something that shouldn’t be this fun,
but absolutely is. There are around 10 levels, each with a different environment,
set of characters, and a ton of interactive elements. You can set traps, start fires,
spike drinks, blow things up, or just sneak around. It's a playground of destruction,
and the freedom it gives you makes every run feel different.

It stands out visually as well. It’s pixel art, but with a faux-3D layer and lighting
effects that make the world pop. Everything looks alive and overly colorful,
which creates a great contrast against the game's dark concept. The lighting is
especially good ~ neon glows, sharp shadows, and flashy effects that somehow don’t
get in the way.

The gameplay demands patience, though. Go in too loud, and the cops will show up
fast. They’re not dumb either, you’ll need to plan exits, blend in with crowds,
or time things perfectly. It’s got just enough stealth to keep you thinking,
but never so much that it slows down the chaos. The audio holds up too. The music
is appropriately intense and synthetic, and the environmental sounds are clear and functional.

Party Hard 2 is stylish, self-aware, and way more strategic than its premise suggests.
It doesn’t try to be deep. It just wants you to have a good time ruining someone else’s,
and it gives you the tools to do that.

So, if the concept doesn’t turn you off, feel free to give it a shot.

## Crysis 2

By Crytek

![Crysis 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/c2.jpg)

Crysis 2 is the shooter that dared to do things differently. Released in an era
dominated by military shooters like _Modern Warfare_ it stood out by not
trying to be realistic. It went sci-fi.

You have a nano-suit which you tactical tools stealth, armor, enhanced mobility but
they all draw from a shared energy source. So you can’t just go invisible forever
or soak up bullets nonstop. You’re constantly weighing your options. Do you sneak
in quietly, dash across open ground, or go in guns blazing? That balance of power
and limitation forces you to think on your feet in a way most shooters don’t.

And the enemies push back. Especially the aliens, they’re fast, aggressive, and mobile.
They don’t just absorb bullets, they make you earn your shots. Gunplay here is solid,
but it’s the way the suit interacts with every fight that keeps things interesting.
You’re not reacting, you’re adapting, adjusting on the fly. You’re in control,
but never fully comfortable.

The level design supports this too. While it’s not an open world, the environments
often give you multiple paths, different angles, and options depending on how you
want to approach a situation. Do you sneak past using stealth ? Do you go loud with
armor and heavy firepower? The game gives you the tools, but it doesn’t tell you
how to use them.

Sure, the story is forgettable and the AI can show its age. But none of that really
drags the experience down. What Crysis 2 nailed back then, and still delivers now
is a smart, tactical shooter that rewards thoughtful play over twitch reflexes.

Whether you're sneaking through ruins or in a full-blown firefight, the music
amplifies every moment without overwhelming it. It’s cinematic, memorable, and a
big part of why the game’s tone still resonates. That alarming sound.. I still
remember it. lol.

Sure, there are better-looking games today, but it's still a great game, and the
remastered version might just make up for its aged graphics.

## Portal 2

By Valve

![Portal 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/markup-mansion-assets/p2.jpg)

Valve somehow took a physics-based puzzle concept and turned it into one of the
most entertaining, clever, and just plain brilliant games out there.

At its core, Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game built around, you know, portals.
You shoot one here, one there, and step through. Sometimes you're sending yourself
flying, other times you're tossing objects or redirecting lasers. The concept is
simple, but what the game does with it is ridiculously creative.

The puzzle design is top-tier. It eases you in with simple mechanics, then slowly
builds up the complexity without ever feeling overwhelming. It’s not just about
getting from point A to B, it’s about _how_ you figure it out. You end up using
momentum, timing, and spatial reasoning in ways that are genuinely satisfying.
It’s one of those rare games that makes you feel smart.

Another big standout is the writing and the characters. GLaDOS is still hands-down
my favorite robot ever. Her dry, sarcastic humor is absolutely perfect. Then there’s
Wheatley, who’s just pure chaos, but in the most entertaining way. The way they
play off each other gives the game so much personality, and the dialogue? Always
sharp, clever, and perfectly timed.

I first played this game back in high school, and even now, it still holds up.
The graphics aren’t cutting-edge anymore, but everything else is just as impressive
today. Honestly, it holds up better than most games from its era, and even better
than plenty of newer ones.

And the wildest part? There’s still nothing else quite like it. It really stands
in a genre of its own. If you’ve never played it, you’re missing out on one of
the smartest, funniest, and most memorable games ever made.
