That John Mayer song always gets me thinking ~ [You love who, who you love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSRCpertZn8).

But if that were the whole story, this wouldn't need saying, not everyone we love
is good for us. We as humans, love making simple things... complicated. Especially love.
So let’s dissect the standard modern romantic arc.

- First, there's that spark. You know the one. A quick glance, a funny comment, a
  moment shared out of nowhere. Maybe across a crowded room, maybe swiping through
  a dating app. Something just... clicks.

- Then, the talking starts. You're swapping stories, laughing at silly things, digging
  into childhood memories, complaining about terrible bosses, arguing over the best
  pizza place. It feels easy, or exciting, or both.

- Next thing you know, time starts to pile up. You go on walks, binge a show, maybe cook a meal.
  You're sharing your space, not just physically, but emotionally. That little voice
  in your head starts whispering, "Could this actually be something?"

And then, bam! You hit that fork in the road...

- Maybe one person starts to drift away, slowly, leaving you scratching your head.
- Things get stuck in that awkward "what are we?" limbo.
- Or, you both lean in. With intention. With a clear "yes."

You know, love in a lot of ways feels like a gamble. Ideally, you either fold your
hand early, no big deal, lesson learned. Or you play it out and hit the jackpot.
But it's that messy middle ground that just sucks the life out of you. That's where
so many of our stories get stuck. And that middle ground? It costs you your
time, your energy, your self-worth, even how you think love should feel.

Sometimes you get lucky and bail early. But when it drags on, when you're emotionally
invested in something that's neither going anywhere nor ending, it can quietly steal
years from you. You walk away feeling a little worn out, and the thought of putting
yourself out there again feels... exhausting.

I really like the metaphor of folding early. It can save you a lot of time and
tears. But how do you know when to fold? That’s the tricky part. You have to be
in the game to have a shot at winning it. But if you're dealt a bad hand,
sometimes the smartest move is to step back early, cut your losses, and wait for
the next round.

So here’s a grounded, skeptical and yet hopeful take on how to gauge whether what
you’ve got could actually turn into the real deal. The goal isn’t to turn dating
into a math problem, but to help you waste less time on hands that won’t play out,
and instead stay open for the one that just might be worth going all-in on.

## Spot Red Flags

#### The Wallet Test

- Still dependent on mom and dad. If they’re in their late 20s or 30s and their
  parents are still covering basics, like their phone bill or rent, it’s not “support,”
  it’s arrested development. You want a partner, not someone who still needs pocket money.

- Drowning in debt... with no lifeboat. Having debt isn’t the problem. Pretending
  it’s not a problem? That’s the problem. If they’re ignoring it like it’ll go away,
  that’s the same mindset they’ll bring into a relationship when things get hard ~
  avoid, delay, and hope it magically disappears.

- Can’t keep a job, and it’s never their fault. If they keep “getting screwed over” at work,
  but it happens every six months, the only common denominator is them. Not everyone’s
  against them. They're just unreliable.

#### The Peter Pan Syndrome

- No direction, no purpose. Look, everyone gets lost sometimes. But if their five-year
  plan is “vibe and see,” you might want to vibe elsewhere.

- Avoids routine responsibility. Can’t commit to doing the dishes, but somehow ready
  to commit to you? Can’t manage laundry but wants to move in? Meh.

- Thinks self-improvement is “cringe”. If they laugh at growth, they’ll stay stuck
  and hold you back too.

#### Perpetual Damsel (or Dude) in Distress

- Constantly blaming everyone else for their problems? If it's always someone
  else's fault, guess who's next on the blame train?

- Regularly plays the victim. Life is turbulent, yes. But if every week is a
  disaster and they’re always the casualty, you’re dating a walking storm cloud.

#### Emotional Dysregulation

- Clinging to validation like it's air. You are not their babysitter or therapist.
  If they can’t self-soothe, you’ll burn out being their emotional juice box.

- Is impulsive or can’t delay gratification. If they need everything now, they’ll
  have nothing later, and drag you with them.

- Walking on eggshells around their moods? Bail. You're not responsible for their
  emotional state, they are.

#### Social Dance

- Has unresolved family issues. You’re not dating them, you’re dating the baggage
  they never unpacked. Unresolved family trauma leaks into everything. If they
  haven’t dealt with it, you’ll be dealing with it.

- No close, long-term friendships? If no one who's known them for a decade still
  likes them, it's worth asking yourself why.

- People are disposable to them. If they ghost friends, trash-talk exes, or treat
  waitstaff like NPCs, you’re not special, you’re just next.

#### Lifestyle Disarray

- Chronically disorganized or messy in all areas of life. If their car, house,
  and calendar are disasters, their mind probably is too.

- Has no hobbies, interests, or passions of their own. If they don’t have a life,
  yours becomes their sole entertainment.

- Doesn’t take care of their health. How one treats their body often reflects
  how they’ll treat a partner, a home, or a life together.

If you’re dating someone and you constantly feel like you’re:

- parenting them,
- cleaning up after them,
- walking on eggshells,
- or waiting for them to become the person they could be…

That’s not a relationship. That’s emotional unpaid labor. Cut your losses. You’re
not here to fix people who don’t want to be fixed. You’re here to build something
real, with someone who’s equally ready to build.

This list is just the tip of the iceberg. Red flags come in all shapes and sizes.
Some are glaringly obvious, while others are cleverly disguised by charm and
confidence. Let's dive into how to spot them more clearly before they catch you
completely off guard.

## Ground Work for Red Flags

One of the biggest mistakes I think we make is automatically assuming someone
is a "catch." It's backwards! We get attached too quickly, only to realize way
down the line that the red flags were waving all along. Don't just assume someone
is virtuous, competent, or aligned with you until their actions actually show you
they are.

In the early days, your job is to establish a baseline, a clear mental image of who
this person is when everything is going smoothly. You do that by asking practical,
grounded questions.

1. What does a typical weekday look like for you?
2. What do you enjoy doing when you're not working?
3. What's your relationship like with your family?
4. Have you ever lived on your own or supported yourself?
5. What's the best and worst thing about your job?
6. How do you usually handle disagreements or conflict?
7. What are you like when you're feeling stressed?

Take their answers at face value. Don't overthink every word, but definitely don't
dismiss the details. This is your initial reference point, the yardstick you'll
use to compare their behavior over time.

Red flags often try to hide behind warmth, humor, or that initial rush of chemistry.
And while people can grow, core personality traits like discipline, emotional
regulation, and general temperament tend to be pretty consistent and will surface
eventually. So, if a couple of months in, you notice significant deviations from
that initial baseline, that's likely not just a "phase." That's probably who they
really are.

## Make the Green Flags Pop

If all your time together revolves around fancy dinners, expensive outings, or
picture-perfect Instagram spots, almost anyone can seem like a great match in that
bubble. But real life isn’t always candlelight and cocktails. It gets messy.
It rains. And the kind of person you want is someone who’s going to hold the
umbrella with you, not run for cover.

Here are some things you can do together to really see those green flags shine:

#### Try Low-Ego Tasks

Do something together where there’s no audience, no recognition, no performance.
Tasks that are mundane or tedious like laundry day, organizing a garage, volunteering
behind the scenes. See how they show up when no one is clapping.

- Do they pitch in without being asked?
- Do they treat “boring” work like it’s beneath them?
- Can they find joy or lightness even in the monotony?

These quiet moments aren’t glamorous, but they reveal character. A life partner
is mostly made in the little things, not just the highlight reel.

#### Introduce Discomfort (Gently)

Growth often comes with a little discomfort. Try situations that stretch comfort
zones, a social event where they don’t know anyone, trying a hobby they’re unfamiliar
with, or attending something important to you (even if it’s not “their thing”).

You’re not testing their skills. You’re noticing:

- Are they open or dismissive?
- Curious or controlling?
- Can they be uncomfortable without making it everyone’s problem?

Because life will inevitably throw you curveballs that are unfamiliar, inconvenient,
or not all about them. The right person will navigate those moments with grace.

#### Have a Money Moment

You don’t need to run a full financial background check, but early glimpses
matter. How someone views, handles, and talks about money, especially when it’s
not abundant, gives insight into their values.

- Go thrifting or set a small budget for a date. Are they still engaged and
  generous within those limits?
- When the bill comes, do they offer to split it, assume you'll pay, or
  awkwardly avoid the topic?
- Casually talk about future goals. Does money come up as a tool, a source of
  anxiety, or a status symbol?

Money itself isn't love, but how someone treats it often reflects their broader
attitudes towards care, anxiety, entitlement, or generosity.

#### Let Silence Happen

Spend a few hours together doing absolutely nothing “productive.” No plans, no tasks,
no agenda. Just quiet, everyday coexistence reading, walking, sitting in the same
room doing separate things.

If the silence is peaceful and you both feel at ease, that’s gold.

- Can they sit in stillness without reaching for a distraction?
- Do you feel safe in the quiet together?
- Does the space feel shared, not just filled?

Some of the most intimate relationships are built not just through conversation,
but in the ease of mutual stillness.

#### Take the Road (Literally)

Long hours, unpredictable turns, wrong exits, weird snacks, music disagreements,
and the occasional silence. It's the perfect backdrop for reality to unfold.

- Do they adapt when plans change, or does every deviation trigger drama?
- Control vs. Collaboration: Are they willing to share the wheel, literally and emotionally
  or do they need to dominate decisions?
- Can they enjoy the ride without constant stimulation? Can they recharge in quiet
  or find fun in the simple stuff?

A road trip is like a condensed version of life. There's joy, fatigue, unpredictability,
boredom, and beauty, just like in any long-term relationship. If someone can meet
you in all those moods without needing perfection, you're not just traveling together,
you're building something that can go the distance.

#### Play a Co-Op Game (and Finish It)

Whether it’s a cozy couch co-op or a chaotic online mission, playing a cooperative
video game is a real-time window into teamwork, communication, and emotional regulation.

- How they communicate under pressure: Do they stay calm, offer help, and laugh
  things off or do they blame, bark orders, or shut down?

- Problem-solving style: Are they curious and collaborative, or rigid and reactive?
  Can they handle trying and failing without frustration turning personal?

- Shared goals vs. solo glory: Do they want to “win” together or just win? Are they
  willing to support your role or only focused on their own performance?

- Patience and pace: Do they rush ahead or wait for you? Do they mock mistakes or celebrate effort?

The game might be digital, but the dynamics are very real. How someone treats you
in a shared challenge, even pixelated, says a lot about how they’ll show up in the
real world when the stakes are higher. If you can laugh, strategize, lose, and
keep going as a team, that’s a kind of intimacy that counts.

## Know Thyself (Seriously)

Before you can truly see someone else clearly, you've got to be brutally honest
with yourself. Get clear on what you genuinely want, not just in those dreamy,
abstract terms, but in the nitty-gritty, day-to-day sense. Do you crave a slow-paced
life or a fast-paced one? Deep roots or constant change? Emotional openness,
ambition, gentleness, faith, independence? Whatever it is, name it.

And just as importantly, know what you bring to the table ~ your strengths,
your blind spots, your emotional capacity. Then, be upfront. Don't shrink yourself
to be liked or pretend to be more easygoing than you are. Real connection starts
with authenticity. The right person won't be scared off by your clarity. They'll
be drawn to it because it shows them you're not playing games. You're serious
about building something that lasts.

## You Love Who You Love

Remember, you won't find someone perfect. You'll find someone _real_. Someone with flaws,
but who's (hopefully) aware of them. Someone whose values, pace, and growth align
with yours. Someone who doesn't make life harder, but who joins you in navigating
its challenges.

When you meet them, you won’t feel fireworks. You’ll feel calm. Like, “This makes sense.”
And it will. So don’t wait for love to arrive gift-wrapped. Put yourself out there.
Ask questions. Offer a genuine compliment. Smile. Flirt a little. Mess up. Try again.

## Author's Note

Some friends have pointed out that this blog kind of gives people a cheat sheet to
who I am. And yeah, I get it, if someone really read through all this, they'd probably
learn a lot about how I think, what I value, and how I approach relationships. Honestly?
If someone puts in that much effort, I guess they deserve a date just on commitment alone.

But here’s the thing, as much as this might look like a manual, you can’t fake most
of what I’ve written about. You can try to tick the boxes, sure, but showing up with
real emotional maturity, self-awareness, and consistency? That stuff reveals itself
over time. There’s no shortcut.

So, yeah. Maybe this blog is part reminder, part filter, part therapy. I don’t know.
But I do know it helps me make sense of things. And I hope it helps someone else too.
