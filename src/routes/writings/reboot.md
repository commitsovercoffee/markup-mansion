This space is a reboot. After nearly five years in software development ~ spanning
back-end, front-end, consulting, and a mix of technologies. I’m taking a deliberate
step to document the next phase. I’ve built plenty, learned a lot, but haven't
always left a trail. Projects were scrapped, accounts deleted, work hidden behind NDAs,
or just never published out of a misplaced pursuit of perfection. That ends here.
This blog is where I’ll track what I’m learning, building, and aiming for. No fluff,
no self-doubt—just cold progress. Starting with a technical refresh, and then back
into the code, this time with a paper trail.

## Adventures in Linux

Before diving back into code, I’m starting at the foundation, the tools. Specifically,
my operating system i.e linux. It’s the first thing you interact with, often without
thinking, and if you're serious about being a developer, especially in systems or
backend work, being fluent in linux isn't optional.

So I'm beginning with two [books by William Shotts](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) :

1. The Linux Command Line.
2. Adventures with the Linux Command Line.

Which will form the core of this phase. These aren’t shallow beginner guides,
they go deep, and that’s the point. Master your environment first, and everything
else flows better.
