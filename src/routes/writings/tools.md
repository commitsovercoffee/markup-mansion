## Software

My workstation and laptop both run a [custom arch setup](https://github.com/commitsovercoffee/hope)
with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) and [zed](https://zed.dev/)
being my primary tools. Besides that, I use [these](https://github.com/commitsovercoffee/hope/blob/a98d281d7f9a0f778e21d81386a519415a80cd45/setup.sh)
apps (ones listed under the tui and gui functions in my setup script).

## Hardware

Don't you love the smell of freshly unboxed electronics :P

## My Workstation

I come from a humble background, so owning a machine like this has been a childhood
dream. After saving up for a year, surviving a pandemic and not losing hope during
the global chip shortage, I finally managed to build my PC in 2022.

And I absolutely love it. I love how blazing fast it is and how easily it handles
whatever I throw at it. It is powered by Team Red, whom I support loyally for their
amazing per watt performance and no-nonsense linux support. You can find the specs below:

| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Processor      | AMD Ryzen 5900X                   | Plenty juice to multitask.            |
| Thermal paste  | Thermal Grizzily Kryonaut 1g      | It gets temp down by 2 degrees.       |
| CPU Cooler     | DeepCool AK620                    | This gamble paid off well.            |
| Motherboard    | MSI X570S Tomahawk                | I got a good deal on this.            |
| Graphics       | Asus TUF 6800XT OC                | This was tough to get hands on.       |
| GPU Mount      | Lian Li Anti Sag Bracket          | The lego anti-sag didn't work.        |
| RAM            | Patriot Viper Steel CL16 3200MHz  | Pairs well with tomahawk.             |
| SSD1           | Samsung 980PRO 0.5TB              | For my os & installed apps.           |
| SSD2           | WD SN850X 1TB                     | For my files.                         |
| HDD            | WD Blue 2TB                       | For my backup.                        |
| Case           | Lian Li Lancool II                | Didn't expect it to be so heavy.      |
| Case Fans      | Arctic Freezer 240 x 2F, 120 x 1R | I really like this company.           |
|                | Lian Li 120 x 2T, 120 x 1B        | This came with the Lian Li case.      |
| Monitor        | LG 27" UL500 4K sRGB 99% 60Hz     | Should I have gone with 120Hz 2K ?    |
| Monitor Arm    | Syza Monitor Arm                  | It's been a game-changer.             |
| Webcam         | Rapoo C500, C250                  | Tops logitech at half the price.      |
| Speakers       | Edifier 1855DB Bookshelf          | The poor audiophile's choice.         |
| Microphone     | Maono PM422 Condenser Mic         | Sufficient for taking calls.          |
| Light          | Kreo Slab Key Light               | So I can have the spotlight.          |
| Mouse          | Razer Basilisk V3 Wired           | My latest gamble.                     |
| Keyboard       | Royal Kludge R75 Wired            | The fast silver switches are great.   |
| Drawing Tablet | XP Pen Deco V2                    | For signing and casual doodles.       |
| Desk Mat       | XPG Battleground XL               | Becase the amazon one sucks.          |
| Extension      | Belkin 6 socket x 2               | Just works.                           |

## My Laptop

Having spent a fortune on my workstation already, I had to be more frugal with my laptop purchase.
So I went with the Acer Swift, which has aged surprisingly well. Thanks to the metal body, it
still looks new. Sure, I can't play heavy games on this but it has plenty juice for my workloads,
and gets the job done. On top of that, it' super light and hence makes for a really handy
work machine when I'm on the go.


| Category | Spec                     | Comment                      |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Screen   | 14" IPS FHD 100% sRGB    | Not the best resolution.     |
| Weight   | 1.25 Kg                  | But really portable.         |
| CPU      | Ryzen 7530U              | With a capable CPU.          |
| GPU      | AMD Radeon               | And a crippling GPU.         |
| RAM      | 16 GB LPDDR4X            | Some RAM.                    |
| SSD      | 512 GB SSD NVMe Gen4     | Lots of space.               |
| Features | Wifi 6E, FHD Camera, etc | And a decent feature set.    |

## My Phone

I use an Android phone, the Motorola Edge.

I've been using Motorola for over 5 years. And while the camera isn't exactly award
winning, the phone gets all the essentials right. With a near stock os, a gorgeous
oled panel, all day battery, storage that never runs out and a decent processor,
it's the perfect fit for my low-key usage. Plus, the IP68 adds peace of mind.

## Thats all folks.
