## Software

My workstation and laptop both run a [custom arch setup](https://github.com/commitsovercoffee/hope)
with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) and [zed](https://zed.dev/)
being my primary tools. Besides that, I use [these](https://github.com/commitsovercoffee/hope/blob/a98d281d7f9a0f778e21d81386a519415a80cd45/setup.sh)
apps (ones listed under the tui and gui functions in my setup script).

## Hardware

What's the best smell? The smell of freshly unboxed electronics, no doubt!

## My Workstation

I come from a pretty humble background, so owning a rig like this has always been a dream of mine. After saving up for over a year, going through a pandemic, and dealing with the global chip shortage, I finally managed to build my PC in 2022. And honestly, I couldn’t be happier. It’s been 3 years and I've faced no issues whatsoever.

## My Laptop

When I'm out and about, I take my 14-inch Acer Swift laptop with me. It's lightweight
yet powerful enough to handle all my workloads. Here are the specs :

| Category | Spec                     | Comment                      |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |

| GPU      | AMD Radeon               | And a crippling GPU. 🕹️      |

| SSD      | 512 GB SSD NVMe Gen4     | Lots of space. 🧺            |
| Features | Wifi 6E, FHD Camera, etc | And a decent feature set. 🎊 |

## My Phone

I use an Android phone, the Motorola Edge 40.

Motorola has been my reliable sidekick for over 5 years. While the camera isn't
exactly award-winning, this phone gets all the essentials right. With a pure
android os, a gorgeous oled panel, all day battery, storage that never runs out
and a decent processor, it’s a perfect fit for my low-key usage.

## Thats all folks.
